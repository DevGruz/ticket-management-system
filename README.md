# Simple Ticket Management System
This Python script provides a simple ticket management system that allows users to create events, purchase tickets, view ticket details, and  exit the program. It is designed to be an interactive command-line application.

## Features
1. **Event Creation:** Users can create events by specifying the event name and the total number of tickets available for the event. Events are stored in memory using a dictionary.
2. **Ticket Purchasing:** Users can purchase tickets for a specific event. The script keeps track of the number of tickets sold for  each  event  and decreases the available ticket count accordingly.
3. **View Ticket Details:** Users can view details about tickets purchased for a specific event. The script displays the names of attendees and the number of tickets each attendee has purchased.
4. **Error Handling:** The script includes error handling using  try-except blocks to handle invalid input and other potential errors during execution.
